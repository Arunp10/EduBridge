# EduBridge
Edubridge is a service platform that bridges the gap between final-year students and supervisors. It is essential in finding and connecting students with their particular supervisors. With the help of an EduBridge platform, the supervisor learns more about students' backgrounds and students can also choose their particular supervisor according to their domain. The main feature of our platform is our mentor matching system, suggesting a good match of a particular group with a supervisor. Using our platform, students can get many features like managing their detailed profile, pitching their ideas, getting funding alerts and choosing the right supervisor by visiting their detailed profile, which includes the whole portfolio of the supervisor and their group capacity students can also get reviews by their past faculty members to get selected. Supervisors also have much flexibility. They get to review students' ideas on the one go, set an appointment time to meet physically or can communicate with students virtually.
